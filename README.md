# üß† Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This is a collection of different ML projects I‚Äôve worked on to explore various algorithms, datasets, and problem-solving approaches. Each folder contains a self-contained project demonstrating a specific machine learning task such as classification, regression, or data visualization.
